"Having fun isn't hard, when you've got a library card"

This repo contains 2 projects: 

1. "Scrape" : This was an exercise in scraping a webpage for data and then formatting the information into a dataframe in R. 

2. "Map" : Using the American Community Survey data and the leaflet package, I created a choropleth of Multnomah County showing where people have the least access to broadband internet at home.
